# Typically, we have a separate scenario for each target table, however your
# project's needs may differ.
scenarios:
  - scenario: Building stg_products out of the raw_products

    cases:
      - case: >
          Basic full refresh loading of the historized staging table `stg_products`

          Tested scenarios:
          - milk : this product is present on `2021-01-01`, but is then missing until `2021-01-04` and goes again
                   missing on `2021-01-05`.
                   This is why on the days `2021-01-02` and `2021-01-05` there should be created artificially
                   a deletion for this product.
          - coconut : this product is present on `2021-01-01` and `2021-01-02`, but is then missing on `2021-01-03`
                   and reappears on `2021-01-04`.
                   This is why on the day `2021-01-03` there should be created artificially
                   a deletion for this product.
          - apple : this product is present on all the staged days.
                    This is why no deletions should be present in the `stg_product` table for this product.
